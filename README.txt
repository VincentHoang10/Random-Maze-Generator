I worked by myself.

I used IntelliJ to compile and run my program.

I assumed that the user would only enter in integer values for the row and col
that the user wants the maze to be. I also assumed that the Cell, NGen, Q1Gen, QGen,
Stack1Gen, and a StackGen will be provided.

I did not implement any additional features.

There are no known bugs.

I did not use any outside sources.
